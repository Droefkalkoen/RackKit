"""Best-effort, read-only extraction from ``motherboard_def.lua`` (§4.1).

RE-Blend never writes this file — properties are the developer's contract —
and only needs one fact from it: the ``steps`` count of stepped properties,
to flag a control whose sheet frame count disagrees with the property it
binds (validation table §6.3, e.g. a ``sequence_fader`` on an 8-step property
whose sheet declares ``frames = 3``).

The file is executed in the same sandbox as the GUI2D files; the recorded
``jbox.*`` tables are then walked for anything that looks like a property
definition carrying ``steps``. Anything the walk does not understand is
ignored — this reader must degrade to "no information" rather than fail on
motherboards using SDK features RE-Blend has no model for.
